<h1>Dark Pattern Buster</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Dark Patterns Buster is a project aimed at detecting and classifying manipulative design elements in web and app interfaces known as "dark patterns." These elements trick users into making decisions that they might not otherwise choose, such as hidden fees, forced continuity, or disguised ads. This project leverages deep learning techniques, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), and multimodal approaches to identify and flag such patterns.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><ul><b>Multimodal Analysis</b>: Combines both text and image processing using BART, RoBERTa, and CLIP models to classify UI/UX elements.</ul></p>
